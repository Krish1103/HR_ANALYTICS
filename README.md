# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project
## 🎯 Objective

Employee attrition is one of the biggest challenges for organizations as it affects productivity, hiring costs, and team stability. This project focuses on identifying patterns behind employee turnover by analyzing factors such as age group, salary range, job roles, education background, and years at the company. The goal is to help HR teams quickly identify high-risk areas and improve employee retention strategies.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

## 📈 Key Metrics

The dashboard highlights important KPIs such as Total Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Average Age, Average Salary, and Average Years at Company. These metrics provide a quick snapshot of workforce health and performance.

## 🔎 Insights Generated

Analysis shows that certain job roles and lower salary bands experience higher attrition rates. Employees between the age group of 26–35 show noticeable turnover patterns, while attrition tends to decrease as employees gain more years of experience within the organization.
